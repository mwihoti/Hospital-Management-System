## ðŸš€ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB (local instance or MongoDB Atlas)
- Git
- NPM or Yarn package manager

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mwihoti/Hospital-Management-System.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd Hospital-Management-System
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
# Using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn install
```

### Step 3: Environment Configuration
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of the project with the following variables:

```
# MongoDB Connection String (required)
# Example for local MongoDB: mongodb://localhost:27017/hospital-management
# Example for MongoDB Atlas: mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/hospital-management
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

# JWT Secret for token generation (required)
# Generate a strong random string, e.g., using: openssl rand -base64 32
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key

# NextAuth Secret (required)
# Generate a strong random string, e.g., using: openssl rand -base64 32
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret

# NextAuth URL (required) - your application URL
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Step 4: Database Setup
The application will automatically create the necessary collections in MongoDB when it first runs. However, you may want to create an initial admin user:

```bash
# You can use the provided seed script (if available)
npm run seed

# OR manually create an admin user in your MongoDB database
```

### Step 5: Run the Development Server
```bash
# Using npm
npm run dev

# OR using Yarn
yarn dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Step 6: Build for Production (Optional)
```bash
# Build the application
npm run build
# OR
yarn build

# Start the production server
npm start
# OR
yarn start
```

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### MongoDB Connection Issues
- Ensure your MongoDB instance is running
- Check that your connection string is correct
- If using MongoDB Atlas, ensure your IP address is whitelisted

#### Package Installation Errors
```bash
# Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force

# Try installing again
npm install
```

#### Port Already in Use
If port 3000 is already in use, you can specify a different port:
```bash
# Using npm
npm run dev -- -p 3001

# Using Yarn
yarn dev -p 3001
```

### Development vs Production
- Development mode includes hot reloading and detailed error messages
- Production build is optimized for performance
- Use environment variables to configure different database connections for development and production
